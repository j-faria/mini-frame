Examples on how to work with miniframe. You can find two main classes to work with the frameworks. BIGgp allows you to work with [Rajpaul et al. (2015)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/452/3/2269/1079217) framework, SMALLgp allows you to work with [Jones et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01318) framework. Check the documentation of the classes to learn a bit more, in the future a "guide" will be written to show how the package works.
